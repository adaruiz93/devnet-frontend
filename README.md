# DevNet Front End

# Description
This is the front end repo for the collaborative GA group project number 3.
DevNet provides a space for current students, alumni, and new developers to post interview questions they've encountered during their job search.
The purpose of this is to provide insight for those yet to start their job search, and provide live data for those already searching.
The goal is to build community, offer support and solutions that may not have been previously considered.

# Brief Example
When the backend server is running successfully at http://localhost:3000/devnet you will see the site's landing page.

# List of Features / User Stories
### MVP (Bronze)
ASU I want to post new content containing information about interview questions such as the type of question asked (behavioral or technical) and details about the solution, if any.
ASU I want to edit, update, and delete existing posts.
ASU I want to access the site on different devices with varying screen sizes and have the UI be clean and responsive.

### Silver
ASU I want to create a profile displaying my name, job title and experience, and a relevant list of skills.
ASU I want to post new content that is associated with my user profile, and only edit or delete posts that I have created.

### Gold
ASU I want to interact with other users, keep a list of "friends", and build a network.
ASU I want to customize my profile with a profile photo upload option, cover photo, and layout color options.
Site functionality should include a space to post resumes and receive feedback, as well as discuss current freelance rates and strategies while logging completed jobs.
The UI should be responsive and interactive with functional nav bars and a toggle for "dark" and "light" mode.
